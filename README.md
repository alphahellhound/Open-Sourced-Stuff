# Open-Sourced-Stuff
I was recently bored, so I started looking around my old games; most of my games made before 2 years ago are absolutely not acceptable towards my *personal* standards.

I put together a folder of abandoned and quick projects; some are high quality frameworks, while others are crap things I made as a kid.

Regardless, I hope some people see some use of these.

### Instructions
Download the folder named "free places."
That's all.
